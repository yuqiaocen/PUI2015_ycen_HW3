Both Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 are in Homework3.ipynb

Assignment 1:
I generate 100 samples of different sizes (between 10 to 2000) from 6 different distributions with the population mean of 100. I use normal, poisson, binomial, chisquare, gamma, exponential distribution in the assignment. Then I use a few loops to plot the sample mean against the sample size N and the distribution of all sample means.

Assignment 2:
In assignment 2, I did as the teacher's ipython notebook said. I did z-score test and chisquare in it.
